🚀 Life is too short, let's go back to good old Javascript. At least it's honest about being painful. ⚡

TypeError: Cannot read property 'motivation' of undefined
ReferenceError: sleep is not defined
SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'deadline' in position 1
Error: Maximum call stack size exceeded at procrastination.js:∞

Okay, maybe TypeScript will save us with type safety... 📝

Type 'Burnout' is not assignable to type 'Productivity'
Property 'vacation' does not exist on type 'Developer'
Cannot find name 'Documentation'. Did you mean 'Procrastination'?
Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'

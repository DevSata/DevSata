# 🎯 Time to master this new JavaScript framework and become a 10x developer!
*Famous last words...*

```console
TypeError: Cannot read property 'motivation' of undefined
ReferenceError: sleep is not defined
SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'deadline' in position 1
Error: Maximum call stack size exceeded at procrastination.js:∞
```

Fine, let's switch to Python. It's supposed to be easy, right? 🐍

```console
IndentationError: expected an indented block after 'if life_choices:'
ImportError: No module named 'work_life_balance'
AttributeError: 'Developer' object has no attribute 'free_time'
MemoryError: not enough RAM to load all these browser tabs
```

You know what? Go is the future! Simple, fast, concurrent! 🔥

```console
panic: runtime error: slice bounds out of range [24:24] in day.go
cannot use 'caffeine' (type Coffee) as type Energy in function sleep()
undefined: happiness in scope
build failed: too many meetings imported and not used
```

Okay, maybe TypeScript will save us with type safety... 📝

```console
Type 'Burnout' is not assignable to type 'Productivity'
Property 'vacation' does not exist on type 'Developer'
Cannot find name 'Documentation'. Did you mean 'Procrastination'?
Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'
  // Just like my hopes and dreams
```

Alright, let's go back to good old C. At least it's honest about being painful. ⚡

```console
segfault.c:42: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type 'career_satisfaction'
segfault.c:1337: warning: 'social_skills' is deprecated
segfault.c:∞: error: stack overflow in function 'fix_bug()'
core dumped (along with my soul)
```

You know what? Maybe I should just become a farmer... 🌾

```bash
$ sudo apt install happiness
E: Unable to locate package happiness
$ git commit -m "fix: attempt to restore sanity"
nothing to commit, working tree is chaos
$ make life
make: *** No rule to make target 'life'. Stop.
```
